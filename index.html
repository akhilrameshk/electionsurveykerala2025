    <h1>Election Survey Kerala 2025</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        This independent survey collects feedback from voters in local body wards across Kerala.
        The aim is to understand voter satisfaction with current representatives and expectations
        for the upcoming local body elections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your responses will be combined with those from other participants to create ward‑wise
        analysis about party support, performance of local bodies, and important local issues.
        Individual responses are not shared with any political party or candidate.

      <h2>About this survey</h2>
      <p>
        The questionnaire includes simple multiple‑choice questions about party preference,
        performance of the current local body government, and likely winner in your ward.
        It takes less than five minutes to complete. Please answer honestly based on your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results will be published as charts and tables for each ward, showing overall trends such as
        which party is leading, how satisfied people are with local services, and how many voters are
        undecided. These insights are for civic awareness and research only.
